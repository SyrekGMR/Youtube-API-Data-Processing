# Youtube-API-Data-Processing

This project looks to produce a reliable view-count prediction tool for Youtube videos. The aim is to monitor the number of views throughout the hours following a video upload in an attempt to produce an effective forecast into the future, allowing for the prediction of the view count at a given time. Any such prediction will be subject to factors which would prove difficult to effectively model, hence it will only focus on trends in the number of views, likes/dislikes and comments.
